    The repository contains two folders q1 and q2 each of which contains the Source Codes, Class Diagram and the Documentations. The codes are written in cpp.

Getting Started

    The Project was built in: BOSS GNU/Linux 6 (anoop) 64-bit
    The Project was built using: Sublime Text 3.
    The Documentation was made using Doxygen and Latex.
    The class Diagrams were made using StarUML.

Prerequisities

    g++ Compiler.

Building and running the codes

QUESTION 1

    Open the Folder q1
    Build the code using the following command (random input utility is included in the library itself):
    
    g++ q1.cpp girl_desperate.cpp  boy_geek.cpp boy_generous.cpp boy_miser.cpp girl_choosy.cpp girl_normal.cpp additional_functions.cpp

    
    This will print the relationships in the console and a log.txt file will be generated.

QUESTION 2

    Open the Folder q2
    Build the code using the following command (random input utility is included in the library itself):
    
    g++ q2.cpp girl_desperate.cpp  boy_geek.cpp boy_generous.cpp boy_miser.cpp girl_choosy.cpp girl_normal.cpp gift_utility.cpp gift_luxury.cpp gift_essential.cpp additional_functions.cpp additional_functions_2.cpp couple.cpp

    In this, the value k is also randomly generated.
    This will print the gift exchanges , k happiest couples, k most compatible couples in the console and a log.txt file is created.
